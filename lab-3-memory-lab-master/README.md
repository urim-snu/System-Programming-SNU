# Lab 3: Memory Lab

In this lab, we implement our own dynamic memory manager.

You will learn
   * how a dynamic memory manager works
   * how to implement a dynamic memory manager
   * how to work with macros in C
   * how to work with function pointers in C
   * how to debug code
   * that writing a dynamic memory manager is simple in theory and difficult in practice.

This lab will be conducted in two phases. Phase one focuses on getting started and correctness.
Phase two focuses on different allocation strategies and performance.

This readme describes phase 1; we will amend it later with information about phase 2.

## Important Dates

| Date | Description |
|:---  |:--- |
| Monday, September 28, 18:30 | Memory Lab hand-out |
| Monday, September 28, 18:30 | Memory Lab session 1 |
| Monday, October 5, 18:30 | Memory Lab Lab session 2 |
| Monday, October 12, 18:30 | Memory Lab Lab session 3 |
| Wednesday, October 14, 12:00 | Submission deadline|

There are no separate deadlines for phases 1 and 2. At the end of the lab, both phases should be implemented.

## Logistics

### Hand-out
The lab is handed out via https://teaching.csap.snu.ac.kr/sysprog/2020-fall/lab-3-memory-lab.

Start by forking the lab into your namespace and making sure the lab visibility is set to private. Read the instructions here carefully. Then clone the lab to your local computer and get to work. 

### Submission

Commit and push your work frequently to avoid data loss. Once you are happy with your solution and want to submit it for grading, create a tag called "Submission". The timestamp of the "Submission" tag (which is attached you your last commit and thus has the identical same timestamp) counts as your submission time.

To create a tag, go to your I/O lab repository on https://teaching.csap.snu.ac.kr/ and navigate to Repository -> Tags. Enter "Submission" as the Tag name then hit "Create tag". You can leave the other fields empty.  

If you later discover an error and want to update your submission, you can delete the "Submission" tag, fix your solution, and create a new "Submission" tag. If that happens _after_ the submission deadline, you also need to email the TAs so that they are aware of the update to your submission.


## Dynamic Memory Manager

### Overview

The dynamic memory manager implemented in this lab offers the same interface as the C standard library's memory manager. The API of the dynamic memory manager is as follows:

| API function | libc | Description |
|:---          |:---  |:---         |
| `void* mm_malloc(size_t size)`| `malloc`  | allocate a block of memory with a payload size of (at least) _size_ bytes |
| `void mm_free(void *ptr)` | `free` | free a previously allocated block of memory |
| `void* mm_calloc(size_t nelem, size_t size)` | `calloc` | allocate a block of memory with a payload size of (at least) _size_ bytes and initialize with zeroes |
| `void* mm_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)` | `realloc` | change the size of a previously allocated block _ptr_ to a new _size_. This operation may need to move the memory block to a different location. The original payload is preserved up to _max(old size, new size)_ |
| `void mm_init(void)`  | n/a  | initialize dynamic memory manager |
| `void mm_setloglevel(int level)` | similar to `mtrace()` | set the logging level of the allocator |
| `void mm_check(void)` | simiar to `mcheck()` | check and dump the status of the heap |


### Operation

Since libc's memory allocator is built-in and part of every process on *nix, our memory manager cannot directly manipulate the heap of the process. Instead, we operate on a simulated heap. The interface to control the simulated heap is identical to that offered by the kernel: `sbrk()` and `getpagesize()`.


While the C runtime initializes the heap and the dynamic memory manager automatically when a process is started, we have to do that ourselves, hence the `mm_init()` function. Similarly, the simulated heap has to be initialized before it can be used by calling `ds_allocate()`. 

The following diagram shows the organization and operation of our allocator:

 ```                                        

### Heap Organization

Our memory manager is a 64-bit operator, i.e., one word in the allocator is 8 bytes long. The heap is conceptually organized into blocks. The minimal block size is 32 bytes. Each block must have a boundary tag (header/footer). Free list management is not specified; you can implement an implicit or an explicit free list.

The boundary tags comprise of the size of the block and an allocated bit. Since block sizes are a muliple of 32, the low 4 bits of the size are always 0. We use bit 0 to indicate the status of the block (1: allocated, 0: free).

You are free to add special sentinel blocks at the start and end of the heap to simplify the operation of the allocator.


### API Specification

#### mm_init()

You can assume that `mm_init()` is called before any other operations on the heap are performed. The function needs to initialize the heap to its initial state.

### mm_malloc()

The `void* mm_malloc(size_t size)` routine returns a pointer to an allocated payload block of at least
_size_ bytes. The entire allocated block must lie within the heap region and must not overlap with
any other block.

### mm_calloc()

`void* mm_calloc(size_t nelem, size_t size)` returns a pointer to an allocated payload block of at least
_nelem*size_ bytes that is initialized to zero. The same constraints as for `mm_malloc()` apply.

### mm_realloc()

The `void* mm_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)` routine returns a pointer to an allocated region of at least size
bytes with the following constraints.

* if `ptr` is NULL, the call is equivalent to `mm_malloc(size)`
* if `size` is equal to zero, the call is equivalent to `mm_free(ptr)`
* if `ptr` is not NULL, it must point to a valid allocated block. The call to `mm_realloc` changes
the size of the memory block pointed to by `ptr` (the old block) to `size` bytes and returns the
address of the new block. Notice that the address of the new block might be the same as the
old block, or it might be different, depending on your implementation, the amount of internal
fragmentation in the old block, and the size of the `realloc` request.
The contents of the new block are the same as those of the old `ptr` block, up to the minimum of
the old and new sizes. Everything else is uninitialized. For example, if the old block is 8 bytes
and the new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the new block are identical to the first 8
bytes of the old block and the last 4 bytes are uninitialized. 

### mm_free()

The `void mm_free(void *ptr)` routine frees the block pointed to by `ptr` that was returned by an earlier call to
`mm_malloc()`, `mm_calloc()`, or `mm_realloc()` and has not yet been freed. When when the callee tries to free a freed
memory block, an error is printed.


### Free block management and policies

Free list management is not specified; you can implement an implicit or an explicit free list.

You will implement three types of allocation policies: first fit, next fit, and best fit.

* **First fit**: Searches the dree list from the beginning and chooses the first free block that fits.
* **Best fit**: Examines every free block and chooses the smallest free block that is fits.
* **Next fit**: Similar to first, but instead of starting each search at the beginning of the list, it 
continues the search where the precious allocation left off.



## Handout Overview

The handout contains the following files and directories

| File/Directory | Description |
|:---  |:--- |
| doc/ | Doxygen instructions, configuration file, and auto-generated documentation |
| reference/ | Reference implementation |
| README.md | this file | 
| Makefile | Makefile driver program |
| .gitignore | Tells git which files to ignore |
| datasec.c/h | Implementation of the data segment. Do not modify |
| memmgr.c/h | The dynamic memory manager. A skeletton is provided. Implement your solution by editing the C file. |
| mm_test.c  | A simple test driver program for phase 1 |

### Reference implementation

The directory `reference` contains a simple test driver program. You can use it to understand how our allocator works but should not take the output literally.


## Phase 1

Your task in phase 1 is to implement the basic functionality of the dynamic memory allocator: malloc() and free(). 

### Design

In a first step, write down the logical steps of your program on a sheet of paper. We will do that together during the first lab session.


### Implementation

Once you have designed the outline of your implementation, you can start implementing it. We provide a skeleton file to help you get started.

The skeleton provides some global variables and macros that we think will be helpful,  logging and panic functions, and skeletons for the individual `mm_X()` functions that are more or less complete.

Start by working on `mm_init()`. Use the `mm_check()` function to inspect your heap. Once the initial heap looks good, proceed with the implementation of `mm_malloc()`, followed by `mm_free()`.

Have a look at `mm_test.c` and modify the code in there to test different cases. Have a look at the documentation of `mm_setloglevel()`, `ds_setloglevel()`, and `mm_check()`; these functions will be very handy to understand what's going on and debug your code.

## Phase 2

The description of phase 2 will be provided in the second lab session on Monday, October 5, 18:30.

## Hints

### Skeleton code
The skeleton code is meant to help you get started. You can modify it in any way you see fit - or implement this lab completely from scratch.

### Allocator in the textbook
The textbook contains an implementation of a simple allocator with a free list in chapter 9.9.12. 
It is quite similar to what you need to do here. Try by yourself first. If you are stuck, study the allocator from the book and apply your gained knowledge to your code.

### Final words

Implementing a dynamic memory allocator is easy in theory and very difficult in practice. A tiny mistake may destroy your heap, and to make matters worse, you may not notice that error until a few `mm_malloc()` and `mm_free()` operations later. At the beginning, you may feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to approach this task. 

Do not despair - we will give detailed instructions during the lab sessions and provide individual help so that each of you can finish this lab. After completing this lab, you will understand dynamic memory allocation from both the user and the system perspective.
